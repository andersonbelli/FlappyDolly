# FlappyDolly
## _You control a bird fighting for his life against the evil Dolly The Sheep_

The idea is to create a challenging 'Flappy bird' like game with multiple game modes and achievements.

#### The game

- Game: [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine;
- Art: [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) with manual drawings;
- Sounds: Adobe Premiere and Audacity

> Art still in process. Characters, enemies and background design might change overtime.
